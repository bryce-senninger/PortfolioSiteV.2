              I am a full-stack web developer specialized in HTML, CSS,
              Javascript, React, Node.js, Express, MySQL, and MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previous to coding, I was a student at the University of Utah. I
              entered the University of Utah with 60 credit hours applied to my
              degree from completion of the International Baccalaureate program
              and AP testing in high school, which unfortunately meant I didn't
              have much time to explore my interests in college. Rather quickly
              I found myself diving into upper level classes for my declared
              major, Economics with an Emphasis on Statistical Analysis. As I
              began to worry this field might not be my calling, I also found
              myself increasingly intrigued by the projects my friends in the CS
              department were working on.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to take a step away from the path in front of me and
              explore this curiousity in coding, and began tinkering around with
              HTML and CSS in the fall of 2018. Immediately I fell in love with
              the aspects of problem solving and implemenation of logic. Knowing
              that this was the path that I wanted to take, I decided to enroll
              in the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp offered through the
              University of Utah.
            </p>
            <p>
              The experience from the bootcamp was incredible, very rapidly
              exposing me to many different technologies and giving me the tools
              to take my code to the next level. Running through full front-end
              design, back-end database creation, and the necessary logic
              intersecting the two at a break-neck pace was a thrilling
              experience- and one that taught me quickly how important it is in
              the field of coding to be able to learn new concepts and adapt
              rapidly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I pride myself on my problem solving and learning capabilities,
              and having had them thorougly put to the test and discovering a
              passion in the process has been life-changing for me. I can't wait
              to see what the future holds for me in this exciting field.
